0.0.4 - Database Correction
---------------------------

Release 0.0.3 got away with a test database setting still set.  This release
corrects that and uses the correct source of RDF data.


0.0.3 - Registered People
-------------------------

This release of EDRN_ RDF_ Server provides a new data source: registered
people.  Registered people are people known to EDRN.  This data source
provides RDF descriptions of EDRN people.  In addition, it also fixes the
following issues:

* CA-296: Site-Specific URI Prefix missing on Protocol control panel.  Added
  it in r4905.
* CA-285: Numeric fields of research replaced with actual names; r4906.
* CA-264: Export registered people; r4907.

In addition, we've reduced the amount of test data and made the unit tests run
a lot faster.


0.0.2 - New DB Structure
------------------------

This release of the EDRN_  RDF_  Server accommodates the new DMCC database
structure, particularly for diseases and protocols.  Specifically, it
addresses these issues:

* CA-252: http://ginger.fhcrc.org/dmcc/rdf-data/diseases/rdf produces error
* CA-253: http://ginger.fhcrc.org/dmcc/rdf-data/protocols/rdf produces error

In addition, it updates the functional tests' test database.

0.0.1 - Protocols
-----------------

This release of the EDRN_  RDF_  Server includes implementation of RDF service
for EDRN Protocols and Studies as tracked by the Data Management and
Coordinating Center (DMCC).

In addition, this release contains:

* Fixes to the layout of control panel pages for Body Systems, Diseases,
  Publications, and Site RDF sources.
